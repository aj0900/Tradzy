<h2>What is Tradzy?</h2>
<p>Tradzy is a platform where users can safely trade shoes while being anonymous.</p><br>
<img src="img/authentic.jpg" alt="Authentic" class="center">
<h2>Authenticity Guaranteed</h2>
<p>We here at Tradzy take authenticity very serious and that is why we have experts to check each pair
   that comes in to our warehouse if it is the real deal or not so that our users always get authentic pairs.</p><br>

<h2>Being a Trader</h2>
<p>If you want to trade your pair of shoes, you would search for the shoe you're looking to trade for
   and if another trader withyour desired shoe is looking for your shoe. If yes, you can initiate the trade
   by accepting the trade. If your shoe is not in the list of shoes the traders are looking for then you can
   offer a trade and add cash considerations or ask for ask considerations and what for the traders to respond.
   If they accept, then you can go ahead with the trade, if not, then cannot do the trade.</p>
<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>After a trade has been initialized, both traders will be shipping the shoes to our warehouse where they
   will get authenticated and if the shoes pass the authentication process then they will be shipped to the
   respective parties and the trade will be finalized.</p>
